Working with lists

P01 (*) Find the last box of a list.
Example:
* (my-last '(a b c d))
(D)

P02 (*) Find the last but one box of a list.
Example:
* (my-but-last '(a b c d))
(C D)

P03 (*) Find the K'th element of a list.
The first element in the list is number 1.
Example:
* (element-at '(a b c d e) 3)
C

P04 (*) Find the number of elements of a list.

P05 (*) Reverse a list.

P06 (*) Find out whether a list is a palindrome.
A palindrome can be read forward or backward; e.g. (x a m a x).

P07 (**) Flatten a nested list structure.
Transform a list, possibly holding lists as elements into a `flat' list by replacing each list with its elements (recursively).
Example:
* (my-flatten '(a (b (c d) e)))
(A B C D E)

Hint: Use the predefined functions list and append.
